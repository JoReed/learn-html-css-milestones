        The tags that are in the code snippet are the paragraph tag and the link/anchor
        tag. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are two references for the paragraph tag,
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_p.asp">w3schools</a> and
        <a href="https://html.com/tags/p/">html.com</a>. Here are 2 references for the
        link/anchor tag,
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp">w3schools</a> and
        <a href="https://html.com/tags/a/">html.com</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The relationship between the p tag and the a tag is that the p tag is the
        parent of the a tag since the a tag is nested inside or the p tag.
      </p>
      <p>
        The relationship between the &ltp&gt tag and the &ltp/&gt is that the &ltp&gt
        is the opening tag and tells the web browser that the begining of the paragraph
        starts there and the &ltp/&gt signifies the end of a paragraph. For every &ltp&gt
        there is a matching &ltp/&gt tag.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some if the attributes of the a tag is the "href", "id", "class", and "target".
        The values of each of these attributes is, <br>
        - href = "https://google.com" whose purpose is to give the actual link that when clicked will take to
        website<br>
        - id = "the-best-link" whose purpose is to give it a special id so it can be refrenced in the styles sheet<br>
        - class = "banana" whose purpose is to put this in a class that can be shared with others and refrenced in the sytles sheet<br>
        - target = "_blank" whose purpose is to tell the browers that when the link is clicked it should open a new window<br>
        respectivly.
