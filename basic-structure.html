        Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having
        little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest
        me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the
        watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the
        spleen and regulating the circulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever I find myself
        growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly
        November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily
        pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every
        funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper
        hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me
        from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking
        people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as
        I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball.

        By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the
        great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild
        conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into
        my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of
        them all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.
      </p>

        I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my
        arm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good
        city of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday
        night in December.
